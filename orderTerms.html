                    <p>The Customer agrees to be bound by these Viva Energy Terms & Conditions for any order placed with Viva Energy Online Store for Goods.</p>  
                    <p>The Customer's terms and conditions of purchase (including any delivery conditions on the Customer's order) are excluded. These Viva Energy Terms & Conditions shall apply on an individual order basis only and shall not be construed as conferring an ongoing relationship or term contract between the Customer and Viva Energy. Viva Energy has no obligation to accept any order from the Customer and (unless expressly agreed to the contrary) the Customer has no obligation to place orders with Viva Energy.</p>

                    <br>
                     
                    <h3>1.	Definitions</h3>

                        <li>'Affiliate' means a related body corporate as that term is defined in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and, in relation to Viva Energy, also includes members of the Vitol Controlled Group.</li>
                        <li> 'Business Day' means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday in Melbourne, Victoria.</li>
                        <li>'Customer' means the entity who placed the order and to whom Viva Energy is supplying Goods.</li>
                        <li>'Goods' means any goods or services which Viva Energy has agreed to supply to the Customer.</li>
                        <li>'Viva Energy' means Viva Energy Australia Pty Ltd (ABN 46 004 610 459).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>2. Goods</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Subject to these Viva Energy Terms & Conditions, Viva Energy will sell and the Customer will purchase, quantities of Goods pursuant to orders which are submitted by the Customer and accepted by Viva Energy from time to time. Without limitation, the Customer acknowledges that Viva Energy will not accept orders for Goods in quantities or volume less than the minimum order quantity as notified by Viva Energy from time to time.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3. Price</h3>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>The price payable by the Customer will be calculated based on (at Viva Energy's option) the time and place of delivery, the time and place of loading into the relevant delivery vehicle, or the date that Viva Energy processes the Customer's order. The prices listed on delivery notes are indicative only. Any price indications or price lists issued or advertised by Viva Energy are subject to alteration without notice.</li>
                        <li>The Customer must pay all taxes, duties and other levies imposed or assessed at any time on or in respect of the Goods which are not included in the price.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>4. Goods and Services Tax</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All amounts payable under these Viva Energy Terms & Conditions are exclusive of GST. If any party makes a taxable supply under or in connection with these Viva Energy Terms & Conditions, that party may in addition to the amount payable under these Viva Energy Terms & Conditions, recover from the other party an additional amount on account of GST, calculated by multiplying the amount payable under these Viva Energy Terms & Conditions by the GST rate (within the meaning of the GST law, being 10% currently). Where a taxable supply is made under or in connection with these Viva Energy Terms & Conditions, the party which makes the supply must issue to the other party a valid tax invoice or an adjustment note, as applicable, in accordance with the GST Law.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

For avoidance of doubt, payment will be processed before the Product will be dispatched for delivery,</li>
                        <li>Your credit card is processed via the Cybersource payment gateway. We don't store your credit card details on our website.  The Website uses secure payment data stored in CyberSource's PCI DSS certified data centres. These centres use a Secure Acceptance approach whereby payment data is transmitted from you the customer directly to a secure CyberSource server, where it is securely stored, in conformity with Australian privacy laws.   For added security the entire payment page is also secured using Microsoft Azure's SSL with an Azure SSL certificate. The website is hosted on Microsoft Azure which is a secure, PCI compliant hosting environment.</li>
                        <li>The Customer shall pay all fees and charges determined by Viva Energy, including (without limitation) left on board surcharge, urgent order surcharge, small order quantity surcharge, and any other fee or charge as advised by Viva Energy. Viva Energy reserves the right to change the amount of any of these fees and charges without notice.</li>
                        <li>The Customer shall pay any costs or expenses incurred by Viva Energy in enforcing its rights under these Viva Energy Terms & Conditions, including (without limitation) debt collection fees and legal costs.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>6. Dimensions, Performance data and other Descriptive Details</h3>

                        <li>All technical information (including photographs, drawings, illustrations, weights, dimensions and any other particulars communicated via the online store) is approximate only and to the extent permitted by law, Viva Energy gives no warranty and makes no representation with respect to the correctness, compliance, adequacy or otherwise of that information at its own risk</li>
                        <li>To the extent permitted by statute, any performance data provided by Viva Energy, a supplier or a manufacturer is an estimate only and is provided in good faith but without liability or responsibility on the part of Viva Energy and without the intention that the Customer should rely on it.</li>
                        <li>Unless agreed to the contrary in writing, Viva Energgy reserves the right to offer an alternative brand or substitute product that has characteristics that are materially consistent with the goods offered when necessary. Substitution will not be given effect to until approval is received from the Customer.</li>
                    </ul>
